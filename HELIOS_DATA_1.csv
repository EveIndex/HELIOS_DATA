"The Anoikis Division offers members of Signal Cartel the opportunity to live and operate from structures within wormhole space. Living in a wormhole provides AD members with a variety of new challenges and experiences with the goal of expanding their knowledge and exploration of New Eden.

"The Central Services Division handles everything from cleaning the corridors around the stations to stocking free-range freshly ground coffee for upper management. We do the jobs no one else wants, such as corp logistics and quartermaster services. You need it, we got it, or we�ll get it. Sure, we're not as glamorous as some of the other divisions, but without a foundation of clean floors to stand upon, our corporation wouldn�t be able to shine like it does!

"Signal Cartel is a high-tech corporation. The Engineering Division is a small but international group of dedicated Pest Control professionals who also do a little programming on the side. We write and maintain the corporation�s proprietary software applications to support our recruiting and member management services, the Signal Cartel Academy, the EvE-Scout Rescue Division and our Co-Pilot ALLISON, the Fleet Ops Division, and the Carrier Logistics buyback program.

"Supporting the estimated 42,000 lines of code needed to run Signal Cartel requires a lot of time spent counting lines of code, but we stay motivated by the ideals enshrined in our division motto: �Rest and drink plenty of fluids.� In our spare time, we like to explore the etymology of obscure German idioms.

"EvE-Scout Rescue is one of our oldest programs, what started as a simple quest to place caches of supplies for stranded capsuleers has grown to include a 911 Operator team, Search and Rescue Coordinators, as well as the original, greatly expanded, rescue cache program. The 911 Operator team responds to calls for rescue by stranded capsuleers, helping them access our rescue caches or flying out to shepherd them back to known space. In situations where no rescue cache is present or where those options do not provide any help to the stranded pilot, our search and rescue team takes over heading out when we find a route. The whole program is supported by our co-pilot, Allison, who helps with all aspects of the program from providing cache data to alerting our teams when stranded pilots are located. In accordance with our Credo, these services are free and available to capsuleers of all playstyles and allegiance.

"The Fleet Operations Division was created to help aspiring pilots learn how to take on new roles within fleets, cultivate new skills, and build confidence. The mission of FOD is to help each Signaleer come into confident possession of their innate talents and facilitate knowledge creation and sharing by fostering connections between Signaleers. FOD recognizes that each Signaleer is unique, and we respect individual needs, differences in learning styles, and variations in desired involvement levels.
"

"The Signal Cartel Academy is the educational division of Signal Cartel.  The aim of the Academy is to lay out a simple and efficient framework that enables access to the wealth of knowledge, skills, and expertise found within Signal Cartel through the exchange of information between Signaleers.  One such initiative is Buddy Club, which is an opt-in service that pairs new Signal Cartel members with more seasoned Signaleers (a Buddy) during their early days of corp membership. Buddies are a friendly point of contact that provide help and guidance as new members adjust to life as a Signaleer.
"

"Splunkworks, named as a homage to the famous Lockheed Skunkworks and to Signal Cartel co-founder Johnny Splunk, is the division of Signal Cartel that advises members on selecting, fitting, and flying the best ship for their needs. Regular offerings include updating and revising the Corp Fits, instituting fun �Fitting Challenge� contests, and providing more detailed guides for common Signal Cartel use cases, such as Covops Exploration and Wormhole PvE. In addition, our Splunkworks group is our go-to consultant for Fleet Doctrine concept planning.
